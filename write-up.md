So let's begin.
Choose the file that fits your operating system.

Let's inspect the file.

We can see that the file is executable so let's try to execute it.
So chmod +x challege_linux and run it!

We are getting a password prompt for root@cyberwizards
I tried throwing few random passowrds like: root, toor, password, etc. And it did not work.

Next I tried looking at the binaries as it's a binary challenge.

For that I used Binary.Ninja , an easy to use GUI.
